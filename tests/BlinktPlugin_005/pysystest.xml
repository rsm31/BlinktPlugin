    <title>Test out of range values with plugin and helper</title>    
    <purpose><![CDATA[Check that colour compunent values outside the 0-255 range and intensity
values outside the 0.0-1.0 range are handled correctly. Colour components
should have all but the least significant 8 bits ignored. Intensities less
than zero should result in no change to the intensity, while those greater
than 1.0 should be treated as if they were 1.0.
Visible output should be:
1. Eight upwards (black->white) cycles through 256 grayscale values
2. Eight downwards (white->black) cycles through 256 grayscale values]]>
